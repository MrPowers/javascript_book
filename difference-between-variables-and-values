#Diference between variables and values

The main difference between variables and values is that Variables can change but Values are constant.

Variables are declared and assigned to a value. The following statement declares the Variable "world":

```javascript
var world;
````

Once the variable is created is assigned to a value:

```javascript
var world;
world = "awesome";
````
The shorthand for the previous statement is:
```javascript
var world = "awesome";
````

And since Variables can change, different variables can have the same value;

```javascript
var world = "awesome";
var waterfall = "awesome";
````
