#Adding Variables

You can concadenate the values of different variables. in the next example, the values "Bart" and "Simpson" are concadenated:

```javascript
var first = "Bart";
var last = "Simpson";
first + " " + last
Bart Simpson // result
```

You can also add numbers to a value:

```javascript
var x = "5";
x + 3;
8 // result
```

In JavaScript there are a lot of useful shorthands, sometimes is necessary to add to a sequence of numbers the number 1.

```javascript
var y = 3;
y = y + 1;
```
The shorthand of this operation will be:

```javascript
var y = 3;
y++
```
