Parenthesis can be used to specify the order of operations.  Remember PEMDAS from high school algebra?  The order of operations is parenthesis, exponents, multiplication / division, and finally addition / subtraction.  The following statement will return 7:

```javascript
1 + 2 * 3
```

2 is multipled by 3 and then 1 is added to the product.  The multiplication happens before the addition because multiplication is higher in the order of operations.
 
When parenthesis are added, the order of operations is changed. The following statement (with the same operands and operators) will return 9.

```javascript
(1 + 2) * 3
```
