Parenthesis can be used to specify the order of operations.  Remember PEMDAS from high school algebra?  The order of operations is parenthesis, exponents, multiplication / division, and finally addition / subtraction.  The following statment will return 7:

```javascript
1 + 2 * 3
```

2 is multipled by 3 and then 1 is added to the product.  The multiplication happens before the addition because multiplication is higher in the order of operations.

When parenthesis are added, the order of operations is changed.
